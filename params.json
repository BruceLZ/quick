M. QUICK\r\n  University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, 2012\r\n\r\n\r\n  If you want to use GPU version, please cite:\r\n  Miao, Y: Merz, K.M. J.Chem.Theory.Comput, 2013, 9 (2), 965\r\n \r\n  Tech support: miao@qtp.ufl.edu\r\n************************************************************************\r\n\r\n\r\n1. INSTALLATION\r\n\r\nTo install QUICK, first you may need to configure make.in file. Intel Fortran compiler is recommanded. Then type\r\n\r\n      make quick\r\n\r\nIf you want to install GPU QUICK, NVIDIA CUDA COMPILER is required. You may test 'nvcc --version'. Then type\r\n     \r\n     make quick.cuda\r\n\r\nin ./bin directory, you can find executable files.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. USAGE\r\nWe suggust you to put this direct into PATH. Edit ~/.bashrc, then add this line\r\n\r\n    export PATH=(YOUR QUICK DIR)/bin:$PATH\r\n\r\nwhere (YOUR QUICK DIR) is your directory.\r\n\r\nthe basic principal of QUICK is that the simpler, the better. so in the input file, the first line is calculation\r\ncard. For example\r\n\r\n    HF ncyc=3 energy BASIS=6-31gs denserms=1.0e-7\r\n\r\nThis means HF calculation is wanted, and after 3 cycle, We only calculate difference of Fock matrix, basis set is \r\n6-31g**, and the convergence criteria is 1.0E-7. If you don't know anything about quantum chemistry, this card is \r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nAfter first line, you input your molecule geometry\r\n\r\n\r\n         C           4.5916       2.6127       4.3145\r\n         H           6.8049       4.5138      -2.5775\r\n         H           8.3134       7.7325      -1.0688\r\n         H           4.3547       2.9911       3.3201\r\n         H           4.5176       3.5187       3.7129\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich is the element and x,y,z coordinates respectively.  \r\n\r\nNext, type\r\n\r\n      quick mol.in\r\n\r\nor GPU version\r\n      \r\n      quick.cuda mol.in\r\n\r\nif you save the input file as mol.in. It will generate mol.out as output file.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. About GPU VERSION\r\nCurrently, QUICK support CUDA version 2.0 and up GPU. We tested on GTX580, M2090 and K20. We can't gureentee our program\r\nis flawless, and it is experimental now. If you have any question feel free to email the author.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
